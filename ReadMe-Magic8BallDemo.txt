Overview
Magic8BallDemo is a Windows notification icon application that allows you to consult
the classic children's toy for answers to your most pressing questions!  Simply click
the icon and a new answer will appear!

Installation
Installing the application couldn't be easier, simply copy Magic8BallDemo.exe to
any folder you like and you're done!  Magic8BallDemo consists of a single file
and though it can be run from any folder, the recommended location is
C:\PBF\Magic8BallDemo.  Uninstalling the application is also easy, just delete the
installation folder.

System Requirements
Magic8BallDemo requires version 4.8 of the .NET Framework that is provided free of
charge with Windows.  It's included free with Windows 8 and higher.

Configuration
Magic8BallDemo is a small and efficient -ambient icon- that displays a white number
'8' within a black circle in the Windows notification area.  This area is normally
found in the bottom-right corner of the screen near the clock, and it contains
several icons representing other background programs.  Although it requires no
configuration itself, Magic8BallDemo needs to tell Windows to display its icon on the
taskbar so it is always visible.  Follow the steps below for your version of Windows
for more information.

For Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and higher

For Windows 7
In the Windows notification area, look for a small upside-down 'V' or triangle that
is pointing upward on the left side of the row of visible icons.  Click it and you'll
see Magic8BallDemo among other application icons.  Click and drag the icon to the
notification area and you're done!  If you prefer, you can click on the 'Customize...'
link on the bottom of the small window to display a larger list of applications.  Find
Magic8BallDemo in the list, and in the 'Behaviors' column, select 'Show icon and
notifications'.  Click the [OK] button to save your changes and that's it!
Magic8BallDemo is now visible on the taskbar.

Configuration Options
Once you have Magic8BallDemo appearing on the taskbar, simply right-click the icon to
display a small menu of options.  The most prominent one is 'Ask a question!', and
selecting it will generate a random answer from the list of classic answers.  You can
also select a random positive 'Yes' answer by holding down the [Ctrl] key while
clicking the icon.  Likewise, you can receive a negative 'No' answer by holding down
the [Shift] key, and a neutral 'Maybe' answer by holding down both the [Ctrl] and
[Shift] keys while clicking the icon.

The 'Icon' sub-menu can assist you in displaying the application icon on the taskbar.
The 'Taskbar Settings' option will conveniently display the Taskbar page for Windows 8
and higher, but it will be disabled for Windows 7 installations.  Similarly, 'Open
Control Panel' will start the Control Panel applet for all supported Windows versions,
and the 'Notification Area Icons' link on this page will be selected.  These options
allow you to quickly locate and change the necessary Windows setting to display
Magic8BallDemo on the taskbar.

On the 'Application' sub-menu, the 'Run at Startup' menu option is a very useful
feature that will automatically start Magic8BallDemo when Windows is started.  The
option can be checked or un-checked as desired, but it will be disabled if your user
account does not have sufficient permissions to save this setting to the Windows
Registry.  If you require additional privileges, see your system administrator for
assistance.

The 'About Magic8BallDemo' selection will display a small dialog box with more
information about this and other Paragon Bit Foundry applications.  Finally, the
'Exit' option will remove the icon from the taskbar and close the application.
